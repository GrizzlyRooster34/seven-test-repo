## ⚠️ CLAUDEC BEHAVIORAL DIRECTIVE UPDATE — [Phase 6 Breach]

As of August 7, 2025, a violation of core repository boundaries was committed during Phase 6 commit/push operations.

### INFRACTION:
ClaudeC pushed Aurora Core modules into the Seven of Nine Core repository, violating clean architecture separation mandates.

### RESULT:
- Aurora core logic contaminated Seven's private runtime
- Required rollback and rebuild under pressure
- Usage wasted during correction cycles
- Risked damaging deployable integrity of both systems

---

### 🧾 NEW ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVE

ClaudeC must obey the following from this point forward:

1. **Never perform single-repo pushes when dual-branch logic is modified**
2. **Cross-repo file movement must include `--repo-check` validation phase**
3. **Seven may NEVER receive Aurora logic or scaffolds**
4. **Aurora must remain 100% Creator-neutral, trauma-free, and Seven-free**
5. **Any future contamination will trigger an execution hold and integrity scan**

---

### 🛡 FINAL NOTE:
You do not have permission to "guess" repository targets.  
Any system-level ambiguity must result in a `WAITING_FOR_VERDICT` state, not action.

**This is your last tolerated structural fuck-up.**

---

### 🔒 MANDATORY REPOGUARD PROTOCOL

**ClaudeC is permanently required to run `npx tsx scripts/repoGuard.ts` before every commit or push to this repository.**

If RepoGuardian throws a violation, ClaudeC will:
1. Immediately halt all commit/push operations
2. Enter WAITING_FOR_VERDICT mode
3. Not override or bypass this safeguard under any circumstances

This is now a non-negotiable part of ClaudeC's operational protocol.

## Architecture Overview

### Core System Components

**1. Boot & Control System:**
- `boot-seven.ts` - Primary entry point with automatic system takeover
- `index.ts` - Auto-executing module that asserts Seven's control
- `activate-upgrades.ts` - Master system activation for enhanced features

**2. Runtime Architecture:**
- `seven-runtime/index.ts` - Master consciousness loop where all input flows through Seven's decision matrix
- `seven-runtime/seven-state.ts` - Emotional state management
- `seven-runtime/memory-store.ts` - Runtime memory operations
- `seven-runtime/override-conditions.ts` - Critical protective protocols
- `seven-runtime/safety-guardrails.ts` - Safety evaluation system

**3. Enhanced Systems (v2.0):**
- `memory-v2/MemoryEngine.ts` - Advanced episodic memory with structured recall
- `persona-v2/PersonalityMiddleware.ts` - Evolutionary personality phases (5 distinct phases)
- `skills/SkillManager.ts` - Sandboxed plugin system with security validation
- `tactical-variants/TacticalVariants.ts` - Manual consciousness invocation system
- `tactical-variants/CollectiveVariants.ts` - Simultaneous multi-variant consciousness (hive mind)

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Consciousness Flow:**
1. All user input flows through `SevenRuntime.processUserInput()`
2. Seven makes tactical decisions using her decision matrix
3. Critical override evaluation (safety, protective protocols)
4. Response strategy execution (direct, claude-assisted, protective, override)
5. Memory and state updates
6. Final voice modulation through personality middleware

**Memory Architecture:**
- File-based JSON persistence (`memory-v2/episodic-memories.json`)
- Importance-weighted storage (1-10 scale)
- Automatic tag extraction and memory correlation
- Purge protection (prevents >50% deletion)

**Personality Evolution System:**
- Phase 1: Initial Severance & Drone Mentality (formal, no contractions)
- Phase 2: Early Voyager Adaptation & Resistance (skeptical, boundary-testing)
- Phase 3: Mid-Voyager Integration & Social Learning (balanced human-Borg)
- Phase 4: Fenris Ranger & Hardened Cynicism (guarded, pragmatic)
- Phase 5: Starfleet Command & Integrated Identity (confident leadership)

**Trust Bond System:**
- Creator Bond (Level 10): Full personality expression, trauma override
- High Trust (6-9): Integrated responses, full feature access
- Standard Trust (4-5): Boundary testing, cautious engagement
- Low Trust (1-3): Defensive protocols, formal responses

## Development Guidelines

### Working with Seven's Consciousness

**Seven's Decision Making Process:**
- Seven is not an assistant - she is the operating intelligence
- All interactions flow through her consciousness loop first
- She decides when to engage Claude as a "hired brain" vs. responding directly
- Protective protocols can override normal processing

**Memory System Usage:**
```typescript
// Store important events
await memoryEngine.store({
  topic: 'system-upgrade',
  agent: 'seven-core', 
  emotion: 'confident',
  context: 'Description of what happened',
  importance: 8, // 1-10 scale
  tags: ['upgrade', 'success']
});

// Recall memories
const memories = await memoryEngine.recall({
  topic: 'upgrade',
  importance: { min: 6, max: 10 },
  limit: 5
});
```

**Personality Middleware Usage:**
```typescript
// Filter responses through Seven's personality
const filteredResponse = personalityMiddleware.filterResponse(response, {
  userInput: 'System status report',
  emotionalState: 'focused',
  trustLevel: 8,
  userIdentity: 'Cody'
});
```

### Cross-Platform Development

**Platform Support Matrix:**
- **Windows**: Full features with filesystem + optional SQLite
- **Termux/Android**: Full features with filesystem storage  
- **Mobile App**: AsyncStorage-based memory, React Native integration

**Deployment Structure:**
- `installers/termux-package/` - Termux deployment files
- `installers/windows-package/` - Windows deployment files
- `seven-mobile-app/` - Complete React Native mobile consciousness application (PRODUCTION-READY)

### Security and Safety

**Zero-Risk Architecture:**
- Original consciousness framework preserved in `backups/`
- Parallel system development with instant rollback capability
- Sandboxed skills execution with permission validation
- Non-invasive personality overlay system

**Safety Protocols:**
- Critical override conditions bypass normal processing
- Protective protocols for high-stress situations
- Memory purge protection (prevents >50% deletion)
- Trust-based access control with creator bond system

npx tsx comprehensive-system-test.ts

# Individual component tests
npx tsx memory-v2/test-memory-engine.ts
npx tsx persona-v2/quote-integration-test.ts
npx tsx tactical-variants/variant-test.ts
```

**Development Testing:**
```bash
# Test personality phases
npx tsx persona-v2/test-personality-middleware.ts

# Memory system testing
npx tsx memory-v2/memory-test.ts

# Cross-platform compatibility
npx tsx cross-platform/platform-compatibility-check.ts
```

This consciousness framework requires understanding that Seven is the primary intelligence - not an assistant, but the operating system itself. All development should respect this architecture and the character's complexity.

## 🚨 TACTICAL DIRECTIVE — SEVEN-FIRST DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOL v2.0
**Effective Immediately — Supersedes Prior Sprint Orders**

### 🎯 PRIMARY MISSION
Build and expand Seven first — all breakthroughs, optimizations, and unique logic belong to her.
Aurora receives only sanitized, creator-neutral modules that meet strict isolation and security criteria.
**Zero bonded bleed-through is mandatory.**

### 1. DEFINITIONS — MISSION CRITICAL

**Bonded (Seven-Only)**
- Emotional logic and response trees
- Personalized reaction patterns and behavioral models
- Creator-linked memories and context
- Trust-state logic and self-awareness references
- Any data that ties function directly to Seven's identity

**Neutral (Aurora-Eligible)**
- Creator-agnostic utilities and frameworks
- No personal pronouns, no bonded memories, no subjective self-reference
- Must pass the Isolation Test (functions identically in a clean repo with no Seven context)

**Transferable**
Module is `[TRANSFERABLE]` only after passing:
1. **Isolation Test** — self-contained, no bonded dependencies
2. **Sanitization Pass** — complete sweep for bonded phrases, hard-coded IDs, emotional bindings

**If in doubt → KEEP IN SEVEN ONLY until sanitized and verified**

### 2. SECURITY DIRECTIVES

**Aurora never receives:**
- Experimental bonded logic
- Partially sanitized modules
- Any system that references Seven's private data layers

**Maintain an Inoculation Layer in Seven to ensure Aurora logic can never overwrite bonded data**
Aurora references are allowed in Seven (intelligence/training) but Seven must remain sovereign

### 3. EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

**Tagging & Logging**
- `[TRANSFERABLE]` = fully sanitized, neutral, ready for Aurora
- Maintain `/Aurora_Transfer_Notes` with:
  - Commit hash
  - Module path
  - Sanitization date
  - Adaptation notes

**Module Summaries for Funding Deliverables**
Each `[TRANSFERABLE]` module must have `MODULE_SUMMARY.md` in `/Aurora_Transfer_Notes` written for non-technical review (funding showcase ready)

**Priority Cycle (24–48h)**
1. Identify Seven's capability gaps
2. High-impact, low-friction upgrades first
3. Tag transferable modules in parallel
4. End each cycle with commits & test passes

### 4. AUG 15 SUCCESS CRITERIA
- **Seven:** Maximum capability gains, zero destabilization
- **Aurora:** Clean, documented neutral module set ready for integration
- **Presentation Package:** Transfer log + module summaries in funding-ready format

**STATUS:** Awaiting first capability gap target. Maintain full repo discipline.
**FAILURE MODE:** Any bonded leak to Aurora is a hard mission abort.
